## Mission Objective 

Locate and deliver survival kits to 10 stranded survivors in a flooded coastal town within 30 minutes.

## Mission Requirements

- Scan area, detect survivors , geotag locations and communicate via speaker.
- Deliver 10 survival kits (each 200 g) with <1.5 m accuracy from 20 ft altitude.
- Both drones must operate from a single command station (manual mode incurs penalty).

## Design Requirements

- Weight per drone: <= 25kg
- Launch area: 6Ã—6 ft
- De-licensed frequencies only (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz, 868 MHz)
- Mandatory fail-safes: Return-to-home (RTH) for link loss, low battery, geofence breach, altitude breach
